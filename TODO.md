TO DO:

- more docstrings
- tests
- load program from a string
- "job control" --> supply in a program the inbox, the expected outbox, run it - like a test
- clean up assembler
- keep symbols around,
  x  jump to labels by name instead of resolving them
  -  use symbolic names for memory locations
  x  we could then use the symbols in the actual print-out of the program

- would colors help in the print-out?
